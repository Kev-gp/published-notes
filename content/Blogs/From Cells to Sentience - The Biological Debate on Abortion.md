# From Cells to Sentience: The Biological Debate on Abortion
## Why pursue?

My main interest in this topic lies in the somewhat unsatisfying and insufficient reasoning that pro-lifers and pro-choice advocates tend to give on abortion. This was especially striking during a particular abortion panel discussion some years back when no one came close to defining what constitutes life. Since then, I wanted to understand the underlying arguments from both sides.

Abortion is also an interesting one to take on since the stakes involved are exceedingly high:

1. If pro-choice advocates are right and abortion is merely harmless surgery, then pro-lifers unnecessarily oppress women and are falsely accusing them of homicide
2. But if they're wrong and abortion does end the life of a human being, then pro-choice advocates are guilty of defending the killing of millions of human beings

I suspect much of the confusion and difficulty surrounding this topic falls on whether we can truly ascertain what the unborn truly are. Many skeptics have frequently pointed this out. As Greg Koukl writes,

> If the unborn is not a human person, no justification for abortion is necessary. However, if the unborn is a human person, no justification for abortion is adequate.
> 
> – Greg Koukl, *Precious Unborn Human Persons*

But as I will try to show, pro-lifers can in fact make an argument based on biological definitions that deems the unborn to be biological human beings. And they aren't merely a "clump of cells". Pro-choice advocates, on the other hand, tend to argue using a *philosophical* definition of personhood, but I'll first address the skeptics who do not take a position on abortion since they seem to think "we do not really know when life begins."

**Remark.** Much of the arguments laid forth are summarised from the book *Persuasive Pro-Life* by Trent Horn, and some others are my personal responses to arguments that people shared with me in the past. 

Now on to biology…

## Making the Biological Case

> *An individual human being begins to exist at conception as it becomes a living, whole, human organism that later develops into adulthood.* 

There are three key points to be shown:

1. The unborn are *alive*
2. The unborn are *human*
3. The unborn are *whole organisms*

### Are the unborn alive?

Pro-choice advocates tend to imply that the unborn are non-living things when they claim that the unborn are just a "clump of cells". As such, they are to be treated as mere body parts, like our nails or a piece of hair.

But they are alive since they are receiving nutrients from the mother that causes the fetus to grow via cellular reproduction. Cellular growth is an important criteria, for it explains why we consider plants and animals to be alive. It also distinguishes us from the dead, for they lack "organic unity" and start decaying rather than continuing to grow. It's also why we consider those who are brain-dead to be "legally dead", for the same reason that their body starts decaying.

> [!question]- But the unborn can't survive outside the womb?
> This merely shows that the unborn are alive in certain places, just as we adult humans can only be alive in certain places (not in space, volcano, etc.).

Another way of showing this is to take the contrapositive and ask "what does abortion do to the fetus?" Ultimately, it leads to the death of the fetus. But if it dies, surely it'd have to be alive at some point, would it not?

Now, so what if the fetus is alive? Plenty of other organisms are alive but we don't extend human protection to them. We must then show that they are a special kind of a living thing.

### Are the unborn human?

There is a simple (and also the broadest) biological definition of what constitutes a human being, and that it's a member of the species *homo sapiens*. There are two ways of determining this:

1. **Ancestry**: If the parents of a fetus are cats, then the fetus will be a cat. Likewise, if the parents are human, then the fetus will be human.
2. **DNA**: If a fetus possesses a human genetic code that has approximately 46 chromosomes, then it is a human being.

> [!question]- Why do human beings have "approximately 46 chromosomes"?
> We use "approximately" as not all human beings have 46 chromosomes, such as people with Trisomy 21 or Klinefelter's syndrome, both of whom have 47 chromosomes[^1]. People with Turner's syndrome have only one X chromosome and therefore have 45 chromosomes[^2].

Since the zygote after fertilization does satisfy these two pieces of evidence, we can therefore say it is a biological human being. We'll see that even leading pro-choice philosophers and bioethicists agree on this point:

> Perhaps the most straightforward relation between you and me on the one hand and every human fetus on the other is this: All are living members of the same species, homo sapiens. A human fetus after all is simply a human being at a very early stage in his or her development
> 
> – *David Boonin, A Defense of Abortion* (p. 20)

> It is possible to give ‘human being’ a precise meaning. We can use it as equivalent to ‘member of the species homo sapiens.’ Whether a being is a member of a given species is something that can be determined scientifically, by an examination of the nature of the chromosomes in the cells of living organisms. In this sense there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being.

> [!question]- "Many experts disagree on it"
> If one remains unconvinced of the biological definition and deems it indeterminate since “many experts disagree on it”, then they’ll have to give a separate biological definition that is more accurate or at least explain why the definition above fails. Resorting to hyper skepticism would not really get us anywhere in a discussion.

Perhaps rather expectedly, there's going to be the following rebuttal. If we suppose that it is true that the fetus is alive and human, does it follow that since every cell in our body is alive and human, it is therefore the case that they are human beings? What of the sperm and egg? Does our human protection extend to these?

### Are the unborn whole organisms?

The aforementioned objection above confuses two things. Firstly, we are confusing parts with wholes. The argument that

1. A fetus is alive and human
2. Sperm and egg are alive and human
3. Therefore the fetus is a body part like sperm and egg

would be as fallacious as saying

1. A car is made of metal
2. Nuts and bolts are made of metal
3. Therefore a car is a car part like a nut or a bolt

Things that have traits in common do not imply that they are the same. Rather, we describe the sperm, egg, and other body cells as *parts* of a human body. The fetus on the other hand is a *whole* human body that is able to develop itself over time.

Secondly, it confuses adjectives and nouns. Sperm, egg, fetuses, and toddlers can be said to be *human* in the *adjective* (descriptive) sense, since they possess human DNA. But only fetuses and toddlers are *human* in the *noun* (identifies a person, place, thing or concept) sense of the word.

**Example.** Chicken rice and the Singapore President Mr Tharman are described to be uniquely Singaporean. But clearly only one of them is *a* Singaporean.

> [!question]- "A clump of cells"
> Pro-choice advocates often object that the fetus is only a "clump of cells". But a "clump" is generally used to describe loose collections of things, particularly when the parts do not interact for the good of the whole. We, for example, generally don't describe a functioning camera as a "clump of lenses and sensors".

I thus emphasize the third point. The unborn are not a "clump of cells (and/or parts)" because they are *whole organisms*. To give a simple test, a whole organism generally requires three things:

1. Time
2. Nutrition
3. Proper environment

After which, if it is able to develop toward becoming a mature member of its species, then it is a whole organism and not a mere body part. The individual sperm and egg, or any other body cell fails this test because despite being given these three things, they can never develop into an adult human.

> [!question]- What about *parthenogenesis*?
> 
> A friend of mine once argued that an egg cell can in fact develop into a mature human being through a process known as *parthenogenesis*. It refers to the development of an unfertilised female sex cell without any male contribution. This certainly does happen for some plants, insects, and even lizards, and explains some of the asexual reproduction that occurs among them. He pointed to the following article as an example for human beings[^3]:

> 
> But the idea that there was no sperm involved in creating the boy is simply not true. The boy resulting from a "partial parthenogenesis" where the egg, which did self-activated (cell division) itself, was later fertilised by a sperm cell early in the development.
>

> 
> This explains why the boy has Y chromosome material in some places and only X chromosome material in others. Even if the sperm cell did not infiltrate in the first place, the egg cell only ends as a type of benign tumour called an *ovarian teratoma*[^4]. 

## Expert opinions unveiled

Putting it altogether, these explains why plenty of biologists (particularly embryologists) and philosophers support the notion that the unborn are, at the very least, biological human beings:

> Although human life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed
> 
> – _Human Embryology and Teratology (p. 8)_

> Human life begins at fertilization…
> 
> – Keith Moore and T.V.N. Persaud, *The Developing Human*

> Fertilization: Beginning of a New Organism
> 
> – The title of the fourth chapter of the textbook *Developmental Biology* (Scott Gilbert)

> …from the zygote stage onward, the human embryo has within it all of the internal information needed —including chiefly its genetic and epigenetic constitution—and the active disposition to develop itself to the mature stage of a human organism.
> 
> – Legal philosopher Robert George and bioethicist Patrick Lee

Experts in the field of embryology and human development also once testified before a U.S. senate hearing, and the governing authority concluded the following:

> Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of a human being—a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings[^5].

We also have one of the strongest pro-choice advocate, Peter Singer, that was quoted [[#^1877e4|earlier]]:

> [T]here is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being, and the same is true of the most profoundly and irreparably intellectually disabled human being, even of an anencephalic infant—that is, an infant that, as a result of a defect in the formation of the neural tube, has no brain.
> 
> – Peter Singer, *Practical Ethics, 3rd Edition* (p. 73)

## The road ahead for pro-choice advocacy

While many tend to concede these biological facts, note also the implicit assumption being made here; that we ought to attribute moral value equally to all biological human beings. For people such as Peter Singer, this was his line of attack as he writes:

> The solution, however, is not to accept the pro-life view that the fetus is a human being with the same moral status as yours or mine. The solution is the very opposite: to abandon the idea that all human life is of equal worth[^6].

A dangerous track to go down on, but this puts pro-lifers in a favourable position, for the burden of proof then shifts over to pro-choice advocates to show why certain differences between the born and unborn necessitates attributing unequal moral status. If they are unable to, it'd parallel oppressing people based on morally irrelevant biological traits such as race and gender. This brings us to their *philosophical* definition of what constitutes human beings, and also where the real abortion debate really lies.
