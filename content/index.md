## Welcome

What you see in the graph above is every individual note I’ve made since 2021 in the digital app *Obsidian*, using the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). 

Reading has been and always will be a part of my lifelong habits. Topics range from productivity, writing, and history, to philosophy, mathematics, and general sciences. This site is then where I share things that I have learned and written down over the years, which hopefully you’ll find interesting as well.
